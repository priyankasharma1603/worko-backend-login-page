### Instructions to Start the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/worko-backend.git
    cd worko-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI and other environment variables:
    ```sh
    DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/worko
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. **Start the server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
   or with `nodemon` for development:
    ```sh
    nodemon src/app.js
    ```

### API Testing

Use an API client like Postman to test the endpoints. For example, to list users, send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/worko/user`.

By following these instructions, you should be able to set up and run your Node.js backend project successfully.
